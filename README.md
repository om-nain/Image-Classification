# Object Classification Project

Welcome to the Object Classification project repository! This project is an academic endeavor associated with a course at the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Jodhpur.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a system for object classification, a fundamental task in computer vision. Object classification involves identifying and categorizing objects within digital images or videos. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to create a robust and accurate classification model capable of recognizing various objects with high precision.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The system will be able to classify objects present in images accurately.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **Scalability**: Designing the system to scale efficiently to handle large datasets and real-time classification tasks.
- **Accuracy**: Striving for high accuracy in object classification results through rigorous training and evaluation processes.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the object classification system.
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets used for training and testing.
- `docs/`: Documentation files related to the project with the project landing page.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models or model checkpoints used in the project.
